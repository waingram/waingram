    I am an <span itemprop="jobTitle">Associate Professor</span> at <a href="//vt.edu/" itemprop="worksFor affiliation">Virginia Tech</a>, 
    where I currently serve as <span itemprop="jobTitle">Associate Dean</span> and
    <span itemprop="jobTitle">Executive Director for Information Technology</span> in the <a href="//lib.vt.edu/" itemprop="worksFor">University Libraries</a>, and 
    <span itemprop="jobTitle">Director</span> for the <a href="//cdrs.lib.vt.edu/" itemprop="worksFor">Center for Digital Research and Scholarship</a>.
  </p>
  <p>My research is centered on enhancing the functionality and scope of academic library services by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and other <span itemprop="knowsAbout">natural language processing (NLP)</span> techniques to analyze and derive new value from library collections. Supported by funding from the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/" itemprop="funder">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a>, specifically through grants <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-256638-ols-24" itemprop="funding">lg-256638-ols-24</a> and <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-37-19-0078-19" itemprop="funding">lg-37-19-0078-19</a>, we aim to enrich library collections and empower research communities by leveraging <span itemprop="knowsAbout">artificial intelligence (AI)</span> to unlock the profound potential of <span itemprop="knowsAbout">electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)</span>. Our approach involves developing innovative, service-oriented applications that enhance the depth, reach, and reliability of library services. By applying advanced <span itemprop="knowsAbout">information retrieval</span>, NLP, and other forms of AI, our goal is to enhance the visibility and accessibility of graduate scholarship, position the university as a leader in the innovative use of AI within <span itemprop="knowsAbout">academic libraries</span>, and strengthen the library's reputation as a pioneer in <span itemprop="knowsAbout">digital scholarship</span> and educational technology.</p>
  <p>
    I received a B.A. in <span itemprop="knowsAbout">Cognitive Science</span> from <a href="//virginia.edu/" itemprop="alumniOf">University Of Virginia</a> and an M.S. in <a href="//lis.illinois.edu/" itemprop="knowsAbout">Library and Information Science</a>
    from <a href="//illinois.edu/" itemprop="alumniOf">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2008. My ongoing involvement in projects related to <span itemprop="knowsAbout">scholarly communication, digital preservation, repositories, and digital libraries</span> has led to my current Ph.D. studies in <a href="//cs.vt.edu/" itemprop="knowsAbout">Computer Science</a> at
    Virginia Tech, supervised by Professor <a href="//fox.cs.vt.edu" itemprop="colleague">Edward A. Fox</a>, focusing on <span itemprop="knowsAbout">NLP</span> and <span itemprop="knowsAbout">machine/deep learning</span> applied to <span itemprop="knowsAbout">scholarly big data</span>.
