  <p itemprop="description">I am an assistant professor at <a href="//vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</a>, where I currently
    serve as associate dean and
    executive director for information technology in the <a href="//lib.vt.edu/">University Libraries</a>.
  </p>
  <p>My research involves devising methods for computational
    analysis and use of the large digital collections held by libraries
    and archives. I am especially interested in <a href="//opening-etds.github.io/"><span
        itemprop="knowsAbout">electronic theses and
        dissertations</span></a>. Because they are long and contain multiple
    chapters, they more resemble books than research articles. His aim is
    to use methods for information extraction, classification, and
    summarization to uncover the knowledge and data buried in this rich
    corpus of graduate research to facilitate its discovery and equitable use.</p>
  <p>I received the B.A. in <span itemprop="knowsAbout">cognitive science</span> from the
    <a href="//virginia.edu/">University Of Virginia</a> and
    the M.S. in <a href="//lis.illinois.edu/" itemprop="knowsAbout">Library
      and Information Science</a>
    from the <a href="//illinois.edu/" itemprop="alumniOf">University of Illinois at
      Urbana-Champaign</a> in 2008. Since then, I have been involved in
    projects and services related to <span itemprop="knowsAbout">scholarly communication</span>,
    <span itemprop="knowsAbout">digital preservation</span>, repositories and
    <span itemprop="knowsAbout">digital libraries</span>. I am currently
    pursuing a Ph.D. in <a href="//cs.vt.edu/"><span itemprop="knowsAbout">Computer Science</span></a> at
    Virginia Tech, under the supervision of Professor <a href="//fox.cs.vt.edu">Edward A. Fox</a>, with a
    dissertation
    focused on the application of
    <span itemprop="knowsAbout">NLP</span> and <span itemprop="knowsAbout">machine/deep learning</span> to <span
      itemprop="knowsAbout">scholarly big data</span>.
